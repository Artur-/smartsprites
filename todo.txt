Refactorings:

* Introduce a mechanism for parameters

* what smartsprites doesn't do at the moment
  * intelligently handle original background-position and background-repeat
    (infer values from it)
  * always creates a new css file, could have one css file mode too
  * one directive per line, no line breaking support yet
  * if the same image is referenced at many places, you either need to 
    refactor your CSS to have one reference to the image or the image will
	get repeated in the sprite

* what smartsprites will never do (CSS limitations)

* tips:
  * other bits of the sprite show through (image!) -- add exact size to the
    box (not always possible) or add margins to the sprite
  * x-repeated images must be in vertical sprites, y-repeated in horizontal
