* can't support spriting backgrounds that were originally attached at the bottom
  of the box, unless the box has hardcoded dimensions (in which case you can set top 
  margin of the sprite to the appropriate number). This is because background
  position is relative to the top left corner. Ok, you could do one image that is
  at the bottom of the sprite and had large top margin, but this looks like an edge case.
